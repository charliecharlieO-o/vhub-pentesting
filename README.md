# BlackBox VM Pentesting Journal

This is a journal detailing my journey into pentesting using vulnerable VM's, my intention is to record as many useful information as possible of what is becoming a pastime of mine. It's not meant to teach anyone how to exploit systems or walk anyone through the process of doing so on foreign systems. It's merely an archive for myself.
